# Rock Paper Scissors

## Backend API

The backend is a run-of-the-mills Spring Boot application. You can run it in all the standard ways.

NOTE: The frontend is hard-coded to look for the backend on port 8080.

## Web UI

The frontend is a very basic Next.js project. To run it, go to the web-ui folder and run "npm run dev".
